# Required Steps for a Passing Submission:
1. Load the 2.5D map in the colliders.csv file describing the environment.
2. Discretize the environment into a grid or graph representation.
3. Define the start and goal locations.
4. Perform a search using A* or other search algorithm.
5. Use a collinearity test or ray tracing method (like Bresenham) to remove unnecessary waypoints.
6. Return waypoints in local ECEF coordinates (format for `self.all_waypoints` is [N, E, altitude, heading], where the droneâ€™s start location corresponds to [0, 0, 0, 0].
7. Write it up.
8. Congratulations!  Your Done!

## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1534/view) Points
### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.  

---
### Writeup / README

#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  

You're reading it! Below I describe how I addressed each rubric point and where in my code each point is handled.

### Explain the Starter Code

#### 1. Explain the functionality of what's provided in `motion_planning.py` and `planning_utils.py`

There are two main files that I have modified 
###### 1.`motion_planning.py` this file differs from  backyard_flyer_solution.py  where the sates [MANUAL ,ARMING ,TAKEOFF ,WAYPOINT ,LANDING ,DISARMING ] has been set to manual where as in motion planning [MANUAL,ARMING,TAKEOFF,WAYPOINT,LANDING,DISARMING,PLANNING] have been set to auto.  backyard_flyer_solution.py has a defines path /waypoint[[10.0, 0.0, 3.0], [10.0, 10.0, 3.0], [0.0, 10.0, 3.0], [0.0, 0.0, 3.0]] where is in motion planning we are setting up the start point , goal are set and the path is derived by A* and further is pruned.

path_prune(self,path): is used to prune path it checks for collinearity, where If the 3 points are in a line remove the 2nd point. The 3rd point now becomes and 2nd point and the check is redone with a new third point on the next iteration.



###### 2.  `planning_utils.py` creates grid, and takes multiple action those are  valid actions,  a_star, heuristic (using np.linalg.), heuristic_func(np.sqrt ..). In A* method i have implemented  diagonal motions with a cost of sqrt(2)
    NORTH_WEST = (-1, -1, np.sqrt(2))
    NORTH_EAST = (-1, 1, np.sqrt(2))
    SOUTH_WEST = (1, -1, np.sqrt(2))
    SOUTH_EAST = (1, 1, np.sqrt(2))

planning utils also validated obstruction for diagonals and removes it in addition to  removing the obstructed NORTH, SOUTH, EAST , WEST

    if (x - 1 < 0 or y - 1 < 0) or grid[x - 1, y - 1] == 1:
        valid_actions.remove(Action.NORTH_WEST)
    if (x - 1 < 0 or y + 1 > m) or grid[x - 1, y + 1] == 1:
        valid_actions.remove(Action.NORTH_EAST)
    if (x + 1 > n or y - 1 < 0) or grid[x + 1, y - 1] == 1:
        valid_actions.remove(Action.SOUTH_WEST)
    if (x + 1 > n or y + 1 > m) or grid[x + 1, y + 1] == 1:
        valid_actions.remove(Action.SOUTH_EAST)
   


And here's a lovely image of my results (ok this image has nothing to do with it, but it's a nice example of how to include images in your writeup!)

### Implementing Your Path Planning Algorithm

#### 1. Set your global home position
Here students should read the first line of the csv file, extract lat0 and lon0 as floating point values and use the self.set_home_position() method to set global home. Explain briefly how you accomplished this in your code.

Lat and Long are defined in the file as first line of the file `colliders.csv' values are reflected as lat0 37.792480, lon0 -122.397450. I have parsed the file to read the first line and used split to row by coma and replace the text value. Once the value has been retrived the same has been applied to home position , below is the code snippet.
    
    with open('colliders.csv') as lat_long:
            latLon = lat_long.readline().rstrip().replace('lat0','').replace('lon0 ','').split(',')
            lat0 = float(latLon[0])
            lon0 = float(latLon[1])
    
    self.set_home_position(lon0, lat0, 0)



And here is a lovely picture of our downtown San Francisco environment from above!

#### 2. Set your current local position
Here as long as you successfully determine your local position relative to global home you'll be all set. Explain briefly how you accomplished this in your code.

In order to get the local position i have to get the global position  which has Long , Lat and alt and this is obtained by self._longitude, self._latitude, self._altitude. Next you will have to get the global home (self.global_home).Once you have both you can use global_to_local method of frame_utils.py () https://github.com/udacity/udacidrone/blob/master/udacidrone/frame_utils.py 
global_to_local(global_position, global_home), Convert a global position (lon, lat, up) to a local position (north, east, down) relative to the home position. Returns  numpy array of the local position [north, east, down]

    global_position = [self._longitude, self._latitude, self._altitude]
    current_local_position = global_to_local(global_position,self.global_home)
    print('global home {0}, global position {1}, local position {2}'.format(self.global_home, self.global_position,
                                                                         self.local_position))
                                                                    
    print('current_local_position {0}'.format(current_local_position))
    
    Following are the values I have received:
    #global home [-122.3957515   37.7932817    0.       ]
    #global position [-1.22397449e+02  3.77924796e+01 -2.80000000e-02]
    # local position [-0.03823025  0.05000484  0.02808646]
    #ccurrent_local_position [-0.04403942  0.05311325  0.028     ]

#### 3. Set grid start position from local position
This is another step in adding flexibility to the start location. As long as it works you're good to go!



        # Read in obstacle map
        data = np.loadtxt('colliders.csv', delimiter=',', dtype='Float64', skiprows=2)
        
        # Define a grid for a particular altitude and safety margin around obstacles
        grid, north_offset, east_offset = create_grid(data, TARGET_ALTITUDE, SAFETY_DISTANCE)
        
        print("North offset = {0}, east offset = {1}".format(north_offset, east_offset))
        # North offset = -316, east offset = -445
        
        
        # Define starting point on the grid (this is just grid center)
        grid_start = (-north_offset, -east_offset)
        
        print(" Grid start --initial that is map center :",grid_start)
        #Grid start --initial that is map center : (315, 445)
        
        # TODO: convert start position to current position rather than map center
        
        grid_start = (int(current_local_position[0]-north_offset), int(current_local_position[1]-east_offset))
        
        print("Grid start after adding map center ", grid_start)
        #Grid start after adding map center  (315, 445)
        
#### 4. Set grid goal position from geodetic coords
This step is to add flexibility to the desired goal location. Should be able to choose any (lat, lon) within the map and have it rendered to a goal location on the grid.

#### 5. Modify A* to include diagonal motion (or replace A* altogether)
Minimal requirement here is to modify the code in planning_utils() to update the A* implementation to include diagonal motions on the grid that have a cost of sqrt(2), but more creative solutions are welcome. Explain the code you used to accomplish this step.

#### 6. Cull waypoints 
For this step you can use a collinearity test or ray tracing method like Bresenham. The idea is simply to prune your path of unnecessary waypoints. Explain the code you used to accomplish this step.



### Execute the flight
#### 1. Does it work?
It works!

### Double check that you've met specifications for each of the [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1534/view) points.
  
# Extra Challenges: Real World Planning

For an extra challenge, consider implementing some of the techniques described in the "Real World Planning" lesson. You could try implementing a vehicle model to take dynamic constraints into account, or implement a replanning method to invoke if you get off course or encounter unexpected obstacles.
